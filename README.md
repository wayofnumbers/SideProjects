## About
These are some of my side projects I did when learning Machine Learning and to explore variant machine learning algorithms and models. Datasets are all public available. 

## Table of Contents


## Image Recognition

### PCA, Feature Extraction, and Kernels
Notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wayofnumbers/SideProjects/blob/master/Image%20Recognitio_PCA.ipynb)
The algorithms used in this project is rather old, these are the techniques before the debut of CNN, yet the data preprocessing, feature engineering, etc. can still provide some reference. 
Techniques used: **PCA**, **Image Pre-Processing**, **Image Visualization**, **Edge Detection**, **Daisy Feature Extraction**, **Gabor Filter**

### Convolving Neural Network (CNN)
